Implement a tabview widget like the ones that will appear in the browser (since I don't have a mock). The mock of the requested tabview had a white background for content and the selected tab. The selected tab was also taller and had a top green border that matched the green of the tabes that are not selected. Green tabs have white text. White tab and content has black text. Font family and sizes as well as spacing (paddings and margins) not specified.
