Implement a tabview widget like the ones that will appear in the browser (since I don't have a mock). The mock of the requested tabview had a white background for content and the selected tab. The selected tab was also taller and had a top green border that matched the green of the tabs that are not selected. Green tabs have white text. White tab and content has black text. Font family and sizes as well as spacing (paddings and margins) not specified.

One variation in my implementation is that I added a small space between the tabs to make it easier to distinguish between two unselected tabs next to each other. Hover would be another way to do this, but that's less mobile friendly.
